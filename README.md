## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was created because of a coding challenge given by an employer. The coding challenge was to generate a report of mutul connections using a social media api. I chose Twitter because of familiarity and past project experience.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>


### Prerequisites

Must install Python for the program to work.



### Installing Packages


```
pip install tweepy
pip install jupyter
pip install webbrowser
```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.



## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The program will prompt the user to provide a follower limit to prevent the program from running for a long time. This is because of Twiiter's request limit. It will also prompt the user to provide two usernames.
